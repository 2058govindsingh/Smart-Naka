# Smart Naka
This is an Android Native application which is developed as a solution for _**ETHOS IIT-G**_ for the problem statement Smart Naka by Assam Police. The detailed problem statement and proposed solution are mentioned furthur in the document.
## Problem Statement:
There is a database of stolen vehicles in the Vaahan portal maintained by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Government of India. We need to create a mobile app integrating with Vaahan portal through API so that a constable executing naka at the road can check the details of a suspicious vehicle in his mobile at real time.
## Proposed Solution:
We intend to solve these problems by using the ANPR technology, OpenCV, Google ML Kit through which weâ€™ll target on providing constables executing naka with a app that can facilitate rapid authentication of stolen vehicles.
